ipats is a small IPA to speech program, built on espeak.

Enter IPA text into the text input area, and press play.
You can also enter X-SAMPA text enclosed in [[double square brackets]].

To install, copy ip_dict and voices/ip into your espeak-data folder, and run ipats 
(linux64 only for the moment).

You can use the espeak voice without this frontend. Just use "-v ip" on the command line,
or select the Ipa voice in whatever frontend you use.

Runtime Dependencies:
    GTK+
    Espeak

To build, run the build script (on linux, requires xfbuild), or do it yourself, with
the options -L-lgtkd -L-lespeak and whatever else you usually compile with for D.

Compile Dependencies:
    DMD 2.053 (or compatible D compiler)
    GTKD
